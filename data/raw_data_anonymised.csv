Some countries still see data/knowledge as something to sell.  I think our policy should contain guidelines to help ITC researchers deal with these situations.  I don't think there is a tailor made solution.

For example, when using IDL-ENVI / Matlab I do not worry about dependencies which is a pain in python/R.. if I use Octave (which I did) then it crashes between the crash and the crash.... the only software that seems to work, with preservation, is QGIS. It also crashes.
packaging is another issue, with IDL, Matlab or .NET is pretty straightforward.

in my carrier, i programmed, professionally, with Fortran, C++, VB.NET, Matlab, IDL, Python and R, the last two were when I decided to move open. i extensively used ESRI_Arc gis and QGIS, also the last one is when I decided to move open. to be honest, now i spend more time on the gritty things than with commercial software, but maybe this is because i am getting old;-)

Open data is a great idea, and i used it many times... i have to get open education digested, and this is the biggest issue of them all.
