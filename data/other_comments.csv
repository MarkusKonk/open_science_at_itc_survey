Making research or eduational materials open access means that all my collaborators need to agree.  This can be hard, even within ITC, but also with partners from other academic cultures/countries where OA is not the norm and holding on to data/knowledge is part of their way of working/business model.;Agreement needed from collaborators, partners, companies, countries where OA is not the norm and keeping data is part of buisness model;All parties involved need to agree;Agreement

Which regulations does ITC provides to protect me if I decide to apply OS? i.e. If I share my early research process (code, data, methods, hypothesis) making sure that I own the exclusivity of the research. ;Regulations of protection;Regulations of protection to ensure exclusivity;Regulations of protection

and then it just doesn't happen unless it goes easy (comes down again to time);Has to be easy and quickly done;Supportive tools;Infrastructure
The code that I write works for me, but I am not a programmer whereby my code can easily be understood and/or re-used;The source code is probably not understandable and reusable for someone else.;Understandability and Re-usability;Understandability and Re-usability
I don't think anything is actively stopping me from doing Open Science...  I understand the principles, premise, benefits and I am gradually changing practices.;No particular obstacles and gradually changing to OS;Undersands and applies OS;Realisation
The documentation of data requires substantial time and effort. Simple to use metadata formats and templates appropriate for mixed spatail and non-spatial data sets are not easy to find. ;Documentation takes too much time and metadata formats and templates are missing.;Documentation difficulties;Documentation
I am a new researcher so I didn't face any cases that I need to do open science yet;OS was not yet relevant;OS was not yet relevant;Relevancy

the review process has not really changed much, and things like open peer review are not really being used;Review process has not changes and OPR is not in use;Not all OS practices are established;Realisation
who says that there are obstacles? for an open science evaluation, this question is rather closed.;-;-;-
